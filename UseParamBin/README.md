# Usage #

First install the ParamBin library (see Installation instructions in the top-level README file).
A simple example of ParamBin usage is in the main.cpp file. To build this example using
cmake, run the following from the command line
```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cd build
make
```
An executable called use_parambin is created in the build directory. 
To run this executable:
```bash
./use_parambin
```
